# c-sharp-challenges

## Goal
The main goal of this repo is to show some of my basic programming skills. NOthing too fancy or too complex, but the bare minium to show that I can program. I'll keep this update 

## How to run
- Make sure you have .NET 6 installed;
- Clone the repo and open Visual Studio to restore the solution, or run dotnet restore;
- You can either run the main code on Program.cs or navigate through the unit tests to understand the scenarios being tested.

## Folders
I have structued this repo in "CodeChallenge" and "RealWork" to represent just the raw algorithm with C# and no further complex OOP(CodeChallenge), but also I have some initial OOP structures and validations to bring it closer to what I would probaly do in a real environment.

## Improvements
All the code shown here can be improved to be used in other structures, such as implementing database connections, recieving/returning data via APIs, etc.

Hope you enjoy :))
